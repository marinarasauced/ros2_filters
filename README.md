# ros2_filters_templates

ROS 2 packages containing templated C++ classes for state estimation filters.

## Overview

This package contains templated state estimation filter classes for traditional state estimation using C++ in ROS 2. Each filter type has a corresponding example package with an implementation of the respective filter for a BlueROV2 scenario. These filter examples were tested using a Gazebo Harmonic [simulation](https://github.com/marinarasauced/bluerov2_gazebo) of a BlueROV2.
